Yeah Kali is good, but did you find everything you were looking for in it ?

This script permits to install some very usefull tools on a Kali machine which are missing by default and yet essential.
It is essentially based on my Hack The Box experience and it is, for the moment, non-exhaustive.

I will update it everytime I discover a new tool.

If you don't want to use some tools, you just have to comment the lines.
Feel free to pull request some new tools !
