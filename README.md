# CTFKali_Setup

This script permits to install some usefull tools on a Kali machine for a CTF use.
It is essentially based on my Hack The Box experience and it is, for the moment, non-exhaustive.

I will update it everytime I discover a new tool.

If you don't want to use some tools, you just have to comment the lines.
